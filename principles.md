# The carwow Engineering Principles


1. __Investigate, Implement ,Iterate__
  
  * We always question and challenge the value of work instead of following blindly; and then we commit to delivering early and often.

2. __Simple and clear Engineering__
  
  * We value simple and clear solutions that solve problems without unnecessary complexity. At the same time we keep the long term vision in mind and don’t just build for today. 

3. __Outside in ownership__
  
  * We value shipping early and observing in production; we are fearless. We believe a developer is responsible for owning their work all the way through to delivering value, including monitoring and performance. 

4. __Sustainable pace__
  
  * Panic and rushing leads to bad decisions, we believe in aggressive scoping appropriately and focussing on value. It leads to better results; with a happier and healthier team. 

5. __Collaborate!__
  
  * Product development is a team effort, we give each other feedback early and often, always respectfully
    * Example: If you touch a new area of the codebase, ask for help 
    * Example: When a feature is too complicated, pair
    * Example: Don’t get stuck for too long, ask for help.

6. __Strive for fast feedback loops__
  
  * We use several practices to achieve the above like TDD, code reviews, continuous delivery, vertical slicing, AB tests, and customer feedback.
  
7. __Evolutionary Architecture__
  
  * We evolve our architecture and technology constantly as our business evolves. We experiment with new technologies at the edges of our systems and adopt carefully and for real business value.
  * Example: elm 
  * Example: single page css
  * Example: some architecture decisions 

8. __Do *big* things in small steps__
  
  * Breaking down big features in small steps doesn’t mean we work only on small incremental improvement. A longer term vision or objective is our north star.

9. __Continuous Improvement__
  
  * We leave code better than we found it. We refactor before developing a feature, to ease its development. 
  Example: 

10. __Reduce code and people dependencies__
  
  * We practice shared code and project ownership. Any team member should be able to work on any project interchangeably and we aim to rotate teams to ensure people have exposure to all parts of the codebase.

11. __We strive to be informed by data as much as possible__

12. __Healthy conflict__
  
  * We believe in a blameless culture; which includes holding each other accountable through respectful feedback

13. __Build what matters__ 
  
  * Engineering effort is a scarce commodity. It should only be applied to problems that “move the needle” for the company
