# The carwow Engineering Principles

1. Investigate, Implement ,Iterate

   * We always question and challenge the value of work instead of following blindly; and then we commit to delivering early and often.

2. Simple and Clear Engineering

3. Outside in ownership

   * We value shipping early and observing in production; we are fearless. We believe a developer is responsible for owning their work all the way through to live, including monitoring and performance. 

4. Sustainable pace
   
   * Panic and rushing leads to bad decisions, we believe in scoping appropriately and focussing on value. It leads to better results; with a happier and healthier team. 

5. Don’t get stuck for too long, ask for help

   * Coding is a team effort, we give each other feedback early and often always respectfully

   *If you touch a new area of the codebase, ask for help 

   *When a feature is too complicated, pair

6. Strive for fast feedback loops via TDD, code reviews, continuous delivery, vertical slicing, AB tests, and customer feedback.

7. We evolve our architecture and tech constantly as our business change. We experiment with new technologies at the edges of our systems and adopt carefully and for real business value.

   * Example: elm 
   * Example: single page css
   * Example: some architecture decisions (like 

8. Build products not code. We focus on delivering value to our customers and we don’t waste time on things that don’t make a difference. Outside-in development helps with this.

   * We don’t waste time managing servers

   * We don’t implement our own email delivery system
   
   * Don’t re-invent the wheel, google it first

9. We follow the boy scout rule and we refactor before developing a feature, so to ease its development. 

   * Example: 

10. Reduce code and people dependencies.

   * We practice shared code and project ownership. Any team member should be able to work on any project interchangeably and we aim to rotate teams to ensure people have exposure to all parts of the codebase.

11. We strive to be informed by data as much as possible

12. Holding each other accountable through respectful feedback

13. Build what matters: 
   * Engineering effort is a scarce commodity. It should only be applied to problems that “move the needle” for the company
